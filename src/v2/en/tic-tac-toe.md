## Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=User1&move=2-2&session=abc123&game=VWXYZ" "https://api.sylvain.pro/v2/tic-tac-toe"
```

## Response

```json
{
  "message": "Move sent successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

If a `username`, `move`, `session`, or `game` value is empty or invalid, if the game is full, if the same player plays twice in a row, or if the move has already been played, an error will be returned.

When a game is over, the request will return the winner and loser names, as well as whether there is a tie. The [/tic-tac-toe/fetch](/v2/en/tic-tac-toe/fetch) endpoint allows retrieving more information about the current game.
