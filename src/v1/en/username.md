# Username Generation

The `/username` endpoint returns a list of adjectives, another with animal names, and the last with professions. A number and a random username are generated from all the information. This endpoint does not require any options.

_The username can consist of one or more elements chosen from the lists or the generated number._

<Endpoint method="get" path="/v1/username" baseUrl="https://api.sylvain.pro" />
